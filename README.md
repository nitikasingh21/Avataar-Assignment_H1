This project demonstrates image generation using **Stable Diffusion** with **ControlNet** for depth conditioning. We generate images based on textual prompts, depth maps, and metadata provided. The objective is to explore the effect of various factors on image generation such as input size, batch size, precision, and aspect ratios.
