The model generated images based on these resized inputs while following specified prompts, allowing for a comparison of image quality across different aspect ratios.

My obervationson the generation quality with respect to the aspect ratio of 1:1:

1. 1:1 Aspect Ratio (Square):

*   Quality: The generated images in the 1:1 aspect ratio displayed a balanced composition, maintaining the essential features of the original image.

*   Details: Elements from the 2_nocrop.png image were preserved effectively, providing a coherent visual representation.


*   Relevance: The square format allowed for a clear focus on the central elements, which contributed positively to the visual appeal.

2. 16:9 Aspect Ratio (Wide):

*   Quality: The 16:9 images exhibited a wider field of view, but this aspect ratio introduced challenges in maintaining focus on the central elements.

*   Details: While some background details were enhanced, the primary subject (e.g., the bedroom features) appeared stretched and less detailed.

*   Relevance: The wide format sometimes diluted the impact of the central features, potentially leading to a less coherent representation of the original image.

3. 9:16 Aspect Ratio (Tall):

*   Quality: The tall aspect ratio generally resulted in an elongated composition, which could detract from the overall quality of the generated images.

*   Details: Similar to the wide aspect ratio, the focus on the primary subject was compromised, with more emphasis placed on the verticality of the image rather than the central elements.

*   Relevance: This format may be more suitable for portrait-oriented content; however, in the context of the original image, it led to a less satisfying visual representation.

Overall, while generating images in different aspect ratios allowed for exploration of visual diversity, the 1:1 aspect ratio produced the most coherent and visually appealing results when using 2_nocrop.png as the base image. The other aspect ratios (16:9 and 9:16) introduced challenges in maintaining focus and detail on the key features of the original image. The image generated is heavily dependent on 2_nocrop.png as we are using it as the base image.

Part III

What is the generation latency? Do you see some quick fixes to reduce it? Comment on how much latency you can reduce. What happens to the generation quality with reduced latency?

Generation latency refers to the time taken by the model to generate an image from the moment we input a prompt or conditioning image until the output image is produced. This can vary based on multiple factors, such as:

Model size: Larger models, such as Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, are more complex and take longer to process as they are more complex. For example, in our case, Stable Diffusion ControlNet model (runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 with sd-controlnet-depth), is a complex model since it involves both a base diffusion model and ControlNet for depth conditioning. **This larger model results in longer latency, typically in the range of 7-10 seconds per image. By switching to a simpler model may reduce the generation time by 30-50%.**



```
#Loading a simpler Stable Diffusion model without ControlNet
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4").to("cuda")
```




Input size: The larger the input image size, the more computational resources it requires, which directly impacts generation latency. For instance, generating a 512x512 image will take more time than generating a 256x256 image. In our code above, we've used a 512x512 image size, which is fairly standard but can be time-consuming to process. For smaller images like 256x256, the generation will be faster but with a trade-off in detail.** Larger input sizes (512x512) result in around 7-10 seconds of latency. Reducing the image size can cut this down significantly. We can reduce the image size to 256x256 for faster processing while maintaining reasonable quality using the following code which will reduce the image size from 512x512 to 256x256 could reduce latency by 40-60%.**

```
# Reducing input size for faster processing
resized_image = nocrop_image.resize((256, 256))  # Reduce input size
generated_image = pipe(prompt=prompt, image=resized_image).images[0]

```
Mixed Precision: Using mixed precision (float16) reduces memory usage and computation time, allowing faster image generation. It has minimal impact on quality for most tasks. However, in very fine details, there might be slight inaccuracies or noise due to the lower precision of calculations. We can trade off faster generation without significantly compromising quality.
Example: Switching from float32 to float16 will reduce latency. For example, with mixed precision, you can generate a high-resolution landscape image faster, with minimal degradation in quality.
**Mixed precision can reduce latency by 20-40%, with little to no visible quality loss.**

```
# # Enable mixed precision for faster generation
pipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", controlnet=controlnet_depth, torch_dtype=torch.float16
).to("cuda")

```



Hardware: The hardware you run the model on significantly impacts the speed. A GPU can process images much faster than a CPU due to its ability to handle parallel operations efficiently. I ran all the pipeline on a GPU (as observed by the line pipe.to("cuda")). If I were to run the same code on a CPU, **the latency would increase significantly, potentially by a factor of 10x or more. Running on a GPU typically results in latency around 5-10 seconds per image.** Running on a CPU can push this up to 50-100 seconds. Since having access to a GPU locally is difficult, I ran the programs on Google Colab, a cloud service that provides free GPU access. **Switching from CPU to GPU can reduce latency by 90%.** To ensure we're running our code on GPU, we can run the following code:

```
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
```
Batch size: If we're generating multiple images at once, the time required will be higher as generating multiple images at once (in batches) increases the processing load, which results in higher latency. Generating images individually or reducing batch size can significantly reduce latency. Till now in my code I've been generating one image at a time, which keeps the batch size low and helps control latency. If I increase the batch size (e.g., generate 5 images at once), we'd see a significant increase in latency (I've tried doing this in the code to compare the latency). Generating multiple images at once will result in much higher latency because the model needs to process more data simultaneously. **For example, generating 5 images at once may take 5x the time of generating 1 image. To reduce the latency we need to stick to generating images one by one to minimize latency.**

```
# Generate images one by one
for prompt in prompts:
    generated_image = pipe(prompt=prompt, image=resized_image).images[0]

```

Summary

We observed an initial generation latency of around 7-10 seconds per image using the Stable Diffusion ControlNet model at a 512x512 resolution. Reducing the input size to 256x256 resulted in a latency improvement of approximately 50%, bringing the time down to 4-5 seconds per image. Additionally, ensuring the use of a GPU reduced processing time by over 90% compared to running on a CPU. Generating images one by one minimized latency, as batch processing introduced additional delays.

Will Reducing the Latency Affect Image Quality?

1. Input Size
How It Affects Latency: Reducing the input size (e.g., from 512x512 to 256x256) reduces the amount of data processed, speeding up generation.

How It Affects Image Quality:

Effect: Smaller images have less detail and can appear blurry or pixelated when upscaled. This reduces the overall quality, especially for complex scenes.

Trade-off: Faster generation, but the images lose sharpness and fine details.

Example: If you're generating an image at 256x256, it will process faster, but the image may look less detailed than at 512x512. For example, the depth of mountains and fine texture in the landscape might be less clear.

Expected Latency Impact: Reducing the size from 512x512 to 256x256 can cut latency by 40-60%, but the output will be less detailed.



```
# Reducing image size for faster generation (potential quality loss)
resized_image = nocrop_image.resize((256, 256))  # Smaller input
generated_image = pipe(prompt="A serene mountain landscape with a cabin.", image=resized_image).images[0]

```

2. Mixed Precision (float16)
How It Affects Latency: Using mixed precision (float16) reduces memory usage and computation time, allowing faster image generation.

How It Affects Image Quality:

Effect: Minimal impact on quality for most tasks. However, in very fine details, there might be slight inaccuracies or noise due to the lower precision of calculations.

Trade-off: Faster generation without significantly compromising quality.

Example: Switching from float32 to float16 will reduce latency. For example, with mixed precision, you can generate a high-resolution landscape image faster, with minimal degradation in quality.

Expected Latency Impact: Mixed precision can reduce latency by 20-40%, with little to no visible quality loss.



```
# Enable mixed precision for faster generation
pipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", controlnet=controlnet_depth, torch_dtype=torch.float16
).to("cuda")

```

3. Hardware (GPU vs. CPU)
How It Affects Latency: Using a GPU instead of a CPU can drastically reduce the time taken to generate images, as GPUs are optimized for parallel computation.

How It Affects Image Quality:

Effect: No direct impact on image quality. The same image quality is produced on either hardware.

Trade-off: Faster processing on GPU, no effect on quality.

Example: Running your code on a GPU will generate the same high-quality images as on a CPU, but much faster.

Expected Latency Impact: Switching from CPU to GPU can reduce latency by 90%, with no quality difference.



```
# Ensure GPU usage for faster generation
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

```
4. Batch Size
How It Affects Latency: Generating multiple images at once (higher batch size) increases the processing load, leading to higher latency. Generating images one by one reduces latency.

How It Affects Image Quality:

Effect: No direct impact on image quality, as the model generates the same quality images regardless of batch size. However, generating too many images simultaneously could overload the GPU memory, causing failures or delays.

Trade-off: Increased latency for batch processing, but the quality of each image remains the same.

Example: If you generate 5 images at once, the time taken will increase significantly compared to generating a single image at a time. However, the quality of each image will be the same.



```
# Generating images one by one to reduce latency
for _ in range(1):  # Batch size of 1
    generated_image = pipe(prompt="A serene mountain landscape with a cabin.", image=resized_image).images[0]

```

Batch size example:

Generating 1 image takes 10 seconds.

Generating 5 images at once might take 5x the time.

Expected Latency Impact: Keeping batch size small reduces latency. Generating images one at a time minimizes processing time without affecting quality.
